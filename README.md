# UMassRideshare: https://enigmatic-garden-25331.herokuapp.com

### Overview:

Our app is a rideshare app which we have created for the use of UMASS Students. This app would allow students to search for a ride or offer a ride to and from various airports and UMASS. It is unique as it is specifically designed to make the rideshare process easier than what it is now and it is specifically tailored to UMASS students needs. As of now whenever students need a ride or offer rides they make posts on social media to try and find someone to share a ride with. This is inefficient as posts get lost and it is hard to find people who are leaving at the same time as you. Our app makes this easier with our search and request feature.

There are two types of users: a driver and a passenger. A user can be both at the same time, but not for the same ride. After signing up, the user inputs a route, date, and time, and searches for a ride. If the user is a passenger, theyâ€™ll get a list of matches based on their input, and can request a ride. If the user is a driver, they just have to wait for a notification for a request. After confirmation, the users can contact each other and complete their rides!
