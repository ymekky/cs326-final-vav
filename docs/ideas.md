Innovative Idea
Our app will help UMASS students arrange rides from the airport to campus. Users can choose the time they are planning to go to the airport (or leave the airport) and wait for a possible match. Users put in their campus, airport, and time and try to find any matching rides. Itâ€™s like a mix of uber and a facebook rideshare group. We were inspired by college rideshare groups that currently exist but are unorganized and confusing. This is our improved take on the page that we hope can help college students.

Important Components
Users have to sign up with their student emails, which is safer because it verifies students. We will also have ratings for the driver or rideshare partner to allow people to feel comfortable and safe with their rideshare partner or driver. This helps maintain accountability within the app. It will allow people to find rides quickly and efficiently. It is helping students save money by ridesharing. 

The app will let the user upload themselves as a driver or a person looking for a driver. If a driver, the user can upload the max number of people they are looking to drive. The app will match (possibly multiple) people based on 1) their destination: either UMASS or one of the surrounding locations, Boston Logan Airport, Bradley International Airport, or JFK Airport, and 2) date/time. After the list of matches, the user can message the other user/s and plan out the details.
